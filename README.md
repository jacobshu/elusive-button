# elusive-button

Let's make the worst button ever.

## Ideas

[x] button moves
[] button/background color changes
[] button text is mildly derogatory
[] if page is scrollable, scroll until the button's out of view
[] button transforms out of hover state
[] create fake buttons (perhaps non-HTML versions)
